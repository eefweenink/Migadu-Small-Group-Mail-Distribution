# Mail Distribution System Setup

For actual email distribution, we use **delegations only**.  

### Planning is Key

It is crucial to have a clear plan in advance for how emails should be distributed.  
As an example, we have included the structure of our orchestra (see figure).  


In this setup, there are two main categories:  
- **Orchestra-related emails** (for the musicians)  
- **Organization-related emails** (for the association management and administration)  
- Additional mailboxes for another language (e.g., Dutch)  

### Hierarchical Distribution

The system is hierarchical. For example, an email sent to the orchestra follows these steps:  

1. Email arrives in the **Orchestra mailbox**.  
2. From the Orchestra mailbox, it is distributed to **Sections** (e.g., Strings and Winds mailboxes).  
3. From Section mailboxes, emails are sent to **instrument-specific mailboxes** (Violin, Bass, etc.).  
4. Finally, from the instrument mailboxes, emails are delivered to **individual personal mailboxes**, where external forwarding is configured.  

The same hierarchy is applied to all organizational roles.  
Some members hold multiple roles, and the system ensures that all relevant emails reach their personal mailbox correctly before being forwarded externally.
