# Mailbox Setup

## 1. Create a Migadu Account

Start by creating a Migadu account:  
[Sign up for a Migadu account](https://admin.migadu.com/public/signup)

Follow the instructions — it’s straightforward:  
- Register your domain name  
- Configure the DNS settings (Migadu provides helpful tools)  
- Once the account is active, proceed with payment  

For our needs, the **Micro account ($19/year)** has been more than sufficient.
