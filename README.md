# Migadu-Small-Group-Mail-Distribution
Low-cost guide for setting up a Migadu-based mail distribution system for small groups, clubs, and associations. Covers mailbox structure, delegations, forwarding workarounds, and best practices for shared email use.

## Introduction

Many small organizations, groups, clubs, or other collaborations use email and messaging apps like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram to communicate internally.  
This works well — as long as all members use the same tools and keep the shared information manageable.

The situation changes when:
- Some members do not have (or do not want) to use the chosen messaging app.
- You want to use the communication history as an archive for agreements, documents, photos, videos, etc.
- You need a reliable way to find contact information and keep it up to date.

Without a central system, conversations often become cluttered with:
- Repeated questions (“Where can I find that document?” / “I didn’t get that email.” / “Can you send it again?”)
- Confusion about contact details (“What’s John’s email?” / “Oh, that’s outdated — use this one instead.”)
- Links to files scattered across different cloud storage locations.

While cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.) can help, it often turns messages into a long list of links rather than a smooth communication flow.

That’s why it is useful to choose a communication system that **everyone** in the group uses — and nowadays, that is usually email.  
The next step is to manage it centrally so that:
- Everyone receives all relevant messages.
- Members can easily send messages to the whole group, subgroups, or specific roles.
- The setup is simple to maintain.

My own small organization — a symphony orchestra — faced exactly this challenge.  
We chose email as our main communication channel and used [Migadu](https://migadu.com/) to build a flexible email distribution system with multiple groups and role-based addresses.  

It took some experimentation to get it right, but the current setup is stable and works well for our needs. This guide documents how we did it — so that others can learn from our experience and avoid the initial trial-and-error phase.

## How This Guide is Structured

This guide is divided into several subdocuments, each covering a specific part of setting up and maintaining a Migadu-based mail distribution system for small groups:

1. **[Overview and Concepts](docs/overview.md)**  
   Explains the basic principles of a mail distribution system and how it can help small organizations.

2. **[Mailbox and Group Setup](docs/mailbox-setup.md)**  
   Step-by-step instructions for creating mailboxes, delegations, and shared addresses in Migadu.

3. **[Forwarding and Distribution Rules](docs/forwarding-rules.md)**  
   How to ensure messages are delivered to the right members and subgroups, and handle forwarding limitations.

4. **[Best Practices](docs/best-practices.md)**  
   Tips for managing shared email addresses, keeping communication organized, and avoiding common pitfalls.

5. **[Maintenance and Updates](docs/maintenance.md)**  
   Guidelines for ongoing management, including adding or removing members, reorganizing groups, and archiving emails.

6. **[FAQ and Troubleshooting](docs/faq.md)**  
   Answers to common questions and solutions to issues you might encounter.

Each subdocument can be updated independently, allowing the guide to grow over time while keeping the main README concise.
